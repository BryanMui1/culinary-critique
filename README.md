To test this with backend, create a file called .env in the api folder with a port of your choosing and MongoDB database link:\
PORT={backend_port}\
ATLAS_URI={mongodb_url}\
Then create a .env in the client folder with the follwoing line:\
REACT_APP_PORT={backend_port}\
Create two separate instances of terminal, and cd to api and client. Run npm start, and you should come into errors due to uninstalled dependencies. Install them, and if you could record which ones were needed to run it here in README.md. Make sure both the server and the frontend are both running before doing anything.
