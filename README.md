To test this with backend, create a file called .env in the api folder with the following two lines:\
PORT=5000\
ATLAS_URI={mongodb_url}\
Create two separate instances of terminal, and cd to api and client. Run npm start, and you should come into errors due to uninstalled dependencies. Install them, and if you could record which ones were needed to run it here in README.md. Make sure both the server and the frontend are both running before doing anything.
